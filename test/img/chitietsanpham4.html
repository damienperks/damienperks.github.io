<p><b><h1>5. AIR MAX 97:</h1></b>
</br>
<h2>The Air Max 97 was designed with the runner entirely in mind. The full-length visible air unit provided enough cushioning to comfort high-impact runners and keep casual wearers feeling light on their feet. The AM97 maintained the layered look from the AM95, but offered a sleeker take with its metallic coloring. The 3M stripe wrapping around the shoe gave the sneaker even more flash.</h2></p>
