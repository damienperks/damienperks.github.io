<p><b><h1>2. AIR JORDAN 1:</h1></b>
</br>
<h2>When the Air Jordan 1 arrived in '85, it was with rule-breaking bravado. The banned black-red colorway violated the league's uniform policy and resulted in a $5,000 fine from the NBA each time Michael Jordan wore sneakers. Thus the legacy began. Jordan's rookie campaign in 1984-85 finished with His Airness averaging 28.2 points per game to earn All-Star and Rookie of the Year honors. </h2></p>
