<b><h1>1. NIKE BLAZER :</h1></b>
</br>
â€‹<h2><h2>Longevity is key. The Nike Blazer launched in 1972 as a basketball sneaker and has since showcased tremendous staying power. The immensely versatile shoe can be dressed in a variety of fabrics from genuine leather to suede and canvas. It has been decorated with graphic prints, offering elaborate artwork that contrasts against the minimalist look. The Blazer has the unique ability of reinventing itself for the times.
