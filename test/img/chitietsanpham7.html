<p><b><h1>8. NIKE AIR MAX 90</h1></b>
</br>
</br>
<h2>Known for his work with Michael Jordan, designer Tinker Hatfield created 1990’s Air Max 90—formerly known as the Air Max III—with quickness in mind. The shapes and patterns are constructed to convey speed, while remaining aesthetically appealing for daring color combinations. Once the eye-popping infrared was injected into the AM90, the sneaker became a prime piece for collaborations with Nike</h2></p>
